This program was created for my final project in grade 11 computer programming.
It was created before I was taught about data field visibility, hence why everything is protected.
I have since realized that using an extremely basic neural network and genetic algorithm for
training works on small scale projects like this one where there are only 2 inputs and 2
outputs, but it doesn't really work that well on larger scale projects.
In the next year, I made another AI that was supposed to classify handwritten digits, but it
didn't work because I didn't know that genetic algorithms don't really work on networks
with ridiculous amounts of variables.
